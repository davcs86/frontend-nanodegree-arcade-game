        <ul>
            <li>Move your character with <em>right</em>, <em>left</em>, <em>up</em> and <em>down</em> keys.</li>
            <li>You start with 2:00 as time limit to get as many points as you can:
                <ul>
                    <li>You get +200 of score when you reach the water area.</li>
                    <li>You get -50 of score and -0:10 of time when you collide with a bug.</li>
                    <li>and you get more time by collecting the gems (Blue: +0:30, Green: +0:20, Orange: +0:10). But, collect them as fast as possible since they disappear after a while.</li>
