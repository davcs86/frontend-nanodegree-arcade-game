## How to play

* Move your character with _right_, _left_, _up_ and _down_ keys.

* You start with 2:00 as time limit to get as many points as you can.

* You get +200 of score when you reach the water area.

* You get -50 of score and -0:10 of time when you collide with a bug.

* You get more time by collecting the gems (Blue: +0:30, Green: +0:20, Orange: +0:10). But, collect them as fast as possible since they disappear after a while.

* _Have fun!_
